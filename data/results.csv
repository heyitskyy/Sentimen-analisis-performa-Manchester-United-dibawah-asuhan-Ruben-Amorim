"What a pro Mason Mount is. In a sea of inconsistency, Mason has really shown his worth so far this season. I’m caught between wanting Cunha to start with Šeško and Mbeumo, and wanting Mount to continue to show his graft and experience where it’s needed. 

Senne Lammens needs to stay in that goal now, only a dip in form or injury/suspension should stop him. More VDS than Schmeichel, in my eyes, but either work for me. That the defence can look forward at all times, and not have to worry about what’s behind them, that’s massive.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:24.045619,Positive,0.1,

These comments with hundreds of upvotes backing this guy are so bizarre.. all I see is a modern day snake oil salesman with his obsession about tactics. If you want to look for a blueprint just analyse what Kovac did with Dortmund.. took them from 11th to 4th in less than half a season. He didnt once talk about a system or blamed his players. But it takes way more effort to actually MANAGE a group of humans than just pointing your fingers at a tactics board.

"A system where Maguire is the last man is a clearly flawed system.

"We all see how tough things have been lately — the criticism, the doubts, the pressure. But I want Ruben to remember something crucial: he is a winner. Built a legacy at Sporting —  won trophies, rewrote expectations, showed what a manager from Lisbon could achieve. That wasn’t luck. That was vision, character, and grit.

Everything new brings challenges. What he is facing at Manchester United is part of the journey — the test. It’s when things are hard that his identity, his  philosophy, his belief in what football can be really matter the most. The man who turned Sporting into a force didn’t do so by giving up when the going got tough — he did it by standing firm, learning fast, and pushing forward.

So keep your head high. Reconnect with why you do this, what you believe in, and what you’ve already proven you can deliver. The road may be bumpy now, but if you stay true to your methods, courageous in your decisions, and faithful to your principles, there’s a real chance to leave a mark here too.

You’ve earned the respect to get through this — don’t lose it by doubting yourself. The best stories are born from adversity.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:32.766815,Positive,0.0840656565656565,

What a load of nonsense. We are loosing game not because of a system but it is because of him. He plays Bruno as a 6 when he’s not capable of playing there. He puts Maguire in the centre of the back 3 on the half way line and he has no pace to get back he’s been caught out twice in the last 2 games. He played Dalot at wing back when he it’s even a competent full back. It’s all because of his decisions and he needs to go.

Ten Hag and now Amorhim seemed to want to attack to suit the fans and skeptics but we were conceding too many goals to be effective and too easily I might add.

"Since Sir Alex retired, many famous head coaches have taken charge of this club. However, most of them have struggled under the weight of expectations from the fans, media, and club supporters. In my view, they often acted like they didn’t see the issues clearly. But Amorim feels different to me. He has openly acknowledged the flaws and weaknesses of the club. He never uses empty, overly optimistic words without evidence. Instead, he clearly shares his vision and long-term goals. Even if we’re not there yet, he seems to be steadily moving closer to that future. The match against Real Sociedad was a good example of his vision taking shape. I’ve always supported Manchester United, and I would be truly grateful to witness a new era of glory in the near future.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:42.006670,Positive,0.1935353535353535,

"Be careful Mate. Most of what you find appealing about Amorim is wrapped in what he has been saying. And what he is saying is what you and the fanbase has seen and already know. By comparison  the former Manager, Ten Hag, gave politically correct responses that was disingenuous at best. Ten Hag tried to pull the wool over our eyes but Amorim simply gets out ahead by stating the obvious. That this team is bad is something we all can see, that he is not doing well is what we all can see. So be careful in backing a Manager who tells you what you see and judge him by what he does. Amorim came in November when the team was in 13th. He has  been in charge for some 20 or so Prem games and the team is still 13th. We all agree the team is bad, but he was hired to get improvement and by improvement that would mean above 13th. If he had this team 8th, or anywhere in the top 10, then his work would be judge as successful and the good feelings would be justified. The above game and the last 4 has come against 12th place Real Sociedad, 19th place Ipwich and 18th place Leicester. Wait for the next ten games and see if he still feels different to you. If United finish in the top 10 then by all means , have hope for a better future, if they remain where they were....in the bottom 10, be concern.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:42.006675,Positive,0.101171875,

Utd fans- conman- smooth talking bullshitter.. out of his depth.. asking players to play system their not use to.. ok  conman I think first answers that..smooth operator .. ok so most fans will be happy with Ruben’s honesty.. all ways say how it w/out sugarcoat and for that reason main stream clowned him (took piss).. smooth operator when first as Utd manager ms/media he had charisma to now a clown with no vision..lastly players can’t play his system.. these are professional players that earn a week what most good paying workers would earn in 4years.. so I don’t buy that.. only a formation practise for a month and playing only a game a week more practice.. what was excuse for Grimsby game..?? Fans who say wrong fit for Utd.. and you can be right.. but who wanted who Ruben wanted Utd or Utd wanted Ruben .. the latter.. and who would bring back the glory days to OT..??

I’d be behind Amorim more if he dropped some of the older heads that have sacked 3 or 4 managers and he tried to future plan a bit and play the likes of Amad at RWB, Heaven and Yoro at CB with De Ligt in the middle, Dorgu at LWB, Mainoo as one of the two CDMs (and stopped playing Bruno there) and went with the new front 3 of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko. Even if we did struggle, at least I could see a future vision with younger players and new signings in it and I’d be willing to give him the season.

"No matter if you prefer 4-3-3 or 3-4-3, every coach and formation needs time to build.
If you have players who can adapt to different styles, they will adjust quickly  if not, you can’t expect them to switch formations overnight.

Last season, our squad lacked quality players who could play top-level football maybe only 2–3 players stood out. In attack, it was mostly Bruno carrying us, while Amad was injured for half the season.

When Amorim arrived, he didn’t have much time to train the team. He knows only one system, so we switched from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3. The results were poor for two main reasons:

1/ Players didn’t have enough training in this system.

2/ The squad lacked quality in key positions.

Finishing 15th felt unfair. Many points were lost not because of coaching, but due to:

Individual errors
Selfish play
Poor team chemistry
Weakness in the front three
Lack of physicality in key matches

This season should be much better because:

1/ Physicality is improving.

2/ Players are training in Amorim’s system from the start of the season, every day.

3/ We signed three strong attacking players.

Amorim’s system needs two dynamic, athletic ball carriers in midfield we’re targeting Baleba for this.

Onana is error-prone, so we’re looking for a better goalkeeper to give the defense confidence.

Changing formation or coach won’t magically fix things overnight. Let’s back Amorim for another season to fully build his system.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:47.720798,Positive,0.0416666666666666,

"Hi, my name is Daniela and I'm a Portuguese big football fan. More then just a football fan, I'm a big supporter or Sporting Club de Portugal 💚🦁, one of the biggest clubs in Portugal where a lot of stars came from, including Mr. Ruben Amorim. In spite of being a Benfiquista (Benfica supporter) since his childhood and playing for Benfica for many years, he gave his biggest step forward as a coach at Sporting. And from what I've seen from the last few months in Manchester, I've been having such a big deja vu right now. Just like Man. United, Sporting was terribly down,  with no unity, no identity, nowhere to go. Everything changed when in the final of Liga Cup (winter competition), Sporting was defeated by Sporting Club Braga and guess who was their coach? Ruben. Since that game, just like always, Sporting had the vision to hire him for such a high price, 13M€. And let me tell ya, that he entered in march and till the end of that season he couldn't do much more. The season was already ruined. As well, we lost against Lask and we didn't make it to the European Competitions. However, in the next year, we became champions after 19 years. Thanks to Ruben and his legacy, we became champions 3 times in five years, we became champions without him and the sportive director and we became champions twice in a row. Hoping we will win the third one. With all of this, I need to say that Ruben isn't just any coach. He is a long term coach with the big capacity to communicate and keep the team united. And I'm a 100% sure, he will make it just like he overcame the challenges from the other teams he coached. So I just hope every supporter keeps the faith and confidence in him and not stay just for the fast results.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:58.334962,Positive,0.1086063492063492,

"He could have had any job out there but he took on a sinking ship. That shows character, determination, self-belief, resilience and, quite frankly, balls. He's also always been honest and respectful, never shying away from responsibility.

The LEAST he deserves is a little bit of trust from the fanbase.

The team he inherited was not his so he just needs some time to get rid of deadwood and bring in his players.

Considering the size of the problem, I expect a top 8 finish next season, a top 4 the season after and then a title challenge each year after that.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:58.335247,Positive,0.2303571428571428,

"Yeah I’m sorry to say this bud, but after supporting this club since the day I was born, a week after the treble win in 99, I have gotten to the point where I genuinely believe this club is finished. It’s been realistically finished for many years, and there’s even the argument to be made that the club we once knew hasn’t actually existed since 2005 when these snakes took over the club. Honestly, the real fans left in 2005. Us who stayed are part of the problem. We are the plastics. We never voted with our wallets, and we basically told the Glazers it was okay to be complacent, by not actually boycotting this club until change occurred. So honestly, I genuinely think there’s no shame in walking away now and letting the club fade into nothingness. I really hope I’m wrong, but my head says it’s over, and I’ve started listening to my head for the last year, thanks to my heart letting me get hurt",en,2025-10-06 03:42:58.336403,Positive,0.190625,

"Imma yap a bit about Man United rn. One of their biggest issues? They can’t play against low-block teams. When the opponent parks the bus, United can’t move the ball through tight spaces or create proper chances. And the striker + some mid wingers? Couldn’t finish their dinner.

Against deep defenses, Bruno can’t just spam long balls or hit quick counters and without that, chances dry up. Amorim’s United has actually looked decent vs the Big 6 (purely talking style here), but Bruno’s built for counter attacking, not possession. He’s not press resistant and loses the ball too much for a team tryna play slow, controlled football. 

His best performance was against Liverpool at Anfield his words, not mine, lol. Over all these years, he’s only had one game where he was disciplined, kept possession, and didn’t just hoof the ball. Says a lot.

Mainoo is that press resistant, composed, possession type baller. Pair him with a proper CDM someone like Rodri, Zubimendi, or Caicedo who can drive through midfield and play with their back to goal and top 4 is locked.

For years, Bruno was the only standout in a mid squad. Now they’ve got PL proven players and a striker, so this season’s the real test. If these wingers flop, we all know who to blame. But if they sign that CDM and pair with Mainoo and run a front three of Cunha–Sesko–Mbeumo? That’s beautiful, disciplined, possession football that can actually hurt teams.

Oh and btw, only two clubs were ever in for Bruno, United under Ole (counter-attacking) and Spurs under Mourinho… also counter-attacking. Says a lot.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:59.061007,Positive,0.1099647266313933,
"Possession is overrated but crucial, still it's not complete story. United is focused more on attack, they need to be strong in transition mostly as currently during transition their mid is super shaky. Casemiro is slow and Bruno is not a defensive midfielder per se but still he is forced to go deeper and start attack from backline. If they could replace Casemiro with Baleba or any good DM, Bruno will be able to play like a playmaker which is his natural role.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:59.061008,Positive,0.1217948717948717,
"@@randomguy_069 Yeah, Casemiro is shaky and Bruno’s not a 6, but that’s not what I was getting at. The point is, United don’t have a midfielder who’s press-resistant, can play with their back to goal, and link defense to attack. You need at least two proper no. 6s with those qualities.

City has Rodri and Kovačić who can play deeper and carry the ball forward. Chelsea has Caicedo and even Cucurella when he inverts. Liverpool has Mac Allister and Gravenberch. United? Ugarte and Casemiro… pathetic. That’s why Bruno ends up dropping into a 6 role to connect defense to attack, and he’s just not good at it.

Even if you put him as a pure playmaker, it’s not going to magically work. Like I said, he’s a counter-attacking player he needs space around him, otherwise he’s useless. He’d fit perfectly in most Serie A clubs, Atlético Madrid, or last year’s Ancelotti Real Madrid.

He’s not disciplined and can’t control the rhythm of the game. Honestly, he’s a stat-padding merchant. His “chance creation” is basically spamming hundreds of long balls or through balls, losing possession in the process, and maybe one of them ends up being dangerous. Over the past few years, he was just the average guy in a bad squad, which tricked people into thinking he was elite. 

You will see what I was tryna say abt Bruno in this new season.",en,2025-10-06 03:42:59.061010,Negative,-0.1037583628492719,

I have been a United fan since 2002/03 season and this is the very first time I'm shouting out to my fellows here. After Sir Alex Ferguson this is the first time I am seeing end to end energy and fluidity for 90 minutes. Have seen patches under Solskjaer but this is the real deal. I am targeting 5th for this season. Can be done. We all know Arsenal is the best defensive side and those are the manners in which they score goals 😂. But this is the first time we can actually say that a United side has improved from its previous season under the same coach. Players want to play for him.

I'm not an expert but I got the gift to make anyone hungry to go extra miles in what they do professionally. I swear I can do it for free! Let man united just give me that chance. I got united In my heart for years, and I can do anything for them to comeback like before. Just let me be around for five matches. if not throw me out!!! I'm speaking out of heart for Manchester united I'm not an ordinary fan. This club is a life for me! I wish this man united officials sees this comment. I need to be around Mr amorim I will bring so much spiritually and mentally. I have much to say to this club and the officials for our success on the pitch. I just need an opportunity.

If you want to look for a blueprint just analyse what Kovac did with Dortmund.. took them from 11th to 4th in less than half a season. He didnt once talk about a system or blamed his players. But it takes way more effort to actually MANAGE a group of humans than just pointing your fingers at a tactics board.

"We all see how tough things have been lately — the criticism, the doubts, the pressure. But I want Ruben to remember something crucial: he is a winner. Built a legacy at Sporting —  won trophies, rewrote expectations, showed what a manager from Lisbon could achieve. That wasn’t luck. That was vision, character, and grit.

Everything new brings challenges. What he is facing at Manchester United is part of the journey — the test. It’s when things are hard that his identity, his  philosophy, his belief in what football can be really matter the most. The man who turned Sporting into a force didn’t do so by giving up when the going got tough — he did it by standing firm, learning fast, and pushing forward.

So keep your head high. Reconnect with why you do this, what you believe in, and what you’ve already proven you can deliver. The road may be bumpy now, but if you stay true to your methods, courageous in your decisions, and faithful to your principles, there’s a real chance to leave a mark here too.

You’ve earned the respect to get through this — don’t lose it by doubting yourself. The best stories are born from adversity.",en,2025-10-06 03:46:52.056606,Positive,0.0840656565656565,

City were worthy winners but United had more possession, more shots, more passes attempted and a better pass completion rate. Again at Brentford, they probably win if Bruno doesn’t miss the penalty.

Even if they're coached by Klopp, Ancelotti, Zidane, or Pep and have a wrong mentality,  they will still not perform as expected.

Ten Hag and now Amorhim seemed to want to attack to suit the fans and skeptics but we were conceding too many goals to be effective and too easily I might add.

"Since Sir Alex retired, many famous head coaches have taken charge of this club. However, most of them have struggled under the weight of expectations from the fans, media, and club supporters. In my view, they often acted like they didn’t see the issues clearly. But Amorim feels different to me. He has openly acknowledged the flaws and weaknesses of the club. He never uses empty, overly optimistic words without evidence. Instead, he clearly shares his vision and long-term goals. Even if we’re not there yet, he seems to be steadily moving closer to that future. The match against Real Sociedad was a good example of his vision taking shape. I’ve always supported Manchester United, and I would be truly grateful to witness a new era of glory in the near future.",en,2025-10-06 03:47:06.325098,Positive,0.1935353535353535,

"Be careful Mate. Most of what you find appealing about Amorim is wrapped in what he has been saying. And what he is saying is what you and the fanbase has seen and already know. By comparison  the former Manager, Ten Hag, gave politically correct responses that was disingenuous at best. Ten Hag tried to pull the wool over our eyes but Amorim simply gets out ahead by stating the obvious. That this team is bad is something we all can see, that he is not doing well is what we all can see. So be careful in backing a Manager who tells you what you see and judge him by what he does. Amorim came in November when the team was in 13th. He has  been in charge for some 20 or so Prem games and the team is still 13th. We all agree the team is bad, but he was hired to get improvement and by improvement that would mean above 13th. If he had this team 8th, or anywhere in the top 10, then his work would be judge as successful and the good feelings would be justified. The above game and the last 4 has come against 12th place Real Sociedad, 19th place Ipwich and 18th place Leicester. Wait for the next ten games and see if he still feels different to you. If United finish in the top 10 then by all means , have hope for a better future, if they remain where they were....in the bottom 10, be concern.",en,2025-10-06 03:47:06.325100,Positive,0.101171875,

"Imma yap a bit about Man United rn. One of their biggest issues? They can’t play against low-block teams. When the opponent parks the bus, United can’t move the ball through tight spaces or create proper chances. And the striker + some mid wingers? Couldn’t finish their dinner.

Against deep defenses, Bruno can’t just spam long balls or hit quick counters and without that, chances dry up. Amorim’s United has actually looked decent vs the Big 6 (purely talking style here), but Bruno’s built for counter attacking, not possession. He’s not press resistant and loses the ball too much for a team tryna play slow, controlled football. 

His best performance was against Liverpool at Anfield his words, not mine, lol. Over all these years, he’s only had one game where he was disciplined, kept possession, and didn’t just hoof the ball. Says a lot.

Mainoo is that press resistant, composed, possession type baller. Pair him with a proper CDM someone like Rodri, Zubimendi, or Caicedo who can drive through midfield and play with their back to goal and top 4 is locked.

For years, Bruno was the only standout in a mid squad. Now they’ve got PL proven players and a striker, so this season’s the real test. If these wingers flop, we all know who to blame. But if they sign that CDM and pair with Mainoo and run a front three of Cunha–Sesko–Mbeumo? That’s beautiful, disciplined, possession football that can actually hurt teams.

Oh and btw, only two clubs were ever in for Bruno, United under Ole (counter-attacking) and Spurs under Mourinho… also counter-attacking. Says a lot.",en,2025-10-06 03:47:12.405625,Positive,0.1099647266313933,
"Possession is overrated but crucial, still it's not complete story. United is focused more on attack, they need to be strong in transition mostly as currently during transition their mid is super shaky. Casemiro is slow and Bruno is not a defensive midfielder per se but still he is forced to go deeper and start attack from backline. If they could replace Casemiro with Baleba or any good DM, Bruno will be able to play like a playmaker which is his natural role.",en,2025-10-06 03:47:12.405627,Positive,0.1217948717948717,
"@@randomguy_069 Yeah, Casemiro is shaky and Bruno’s not a 6, but that’s not what I was getting at. The point is, United don’t have a midfielder who’s press-resistant, can play with their back to goal, and link defense to attack. You need at least two proper no. 6s with those qualities.

City has Rodri and Kovačić who can play deeper and carry the ball forward. Chelsea has Caicedo and even Cucurella when he inverts. Liverpool has Mac Allister and Gravenberch. United? Ugarte and Casemiro… pathetic. That’s why Bruno ends up dropping into a 6 role to connect defense to attack, and he’s just not good at it.

Even if you put him as a pure playmaker, it’s not going to magically work. Like I said, he’s a counter-attacking player he needs space around him, otherwise he’s useless. He’d fit perfectly in most Serie A clubs, Atlético Madrid, or last year’s Ancelotti Real Madrid.

He’s not disciplined and can’t control the rhythm of the game. Honestly, he’s a stat-padding merchant. His “chance creation” is basically spamming hundreds of long balls or through balls, losing possession in the process, and maybe one of them ends up being dangerous. Over the past few years, he was just the average guy in a bad squad, which tricked people into thinking he was elite.

"No matter if you prefer 4-3-3 or 3-4-3, every coach and formation needs time to build.
If you have players who can adapt to different styles, they will adjust quickly  if not, you can’t expect them to switch formations overnight.

Last season, our squad lacked quality players who could play top-level football maybe only 2–3 players stood out. In attack, it was mostly Bruno carrying us, while Amad was injured for half the season.

When Amorim arrived, he didn’t have much time to train the team. He knows only one system, so we switched from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3. The results were poor for two main reasons:

1/ Players didn’t have enough training in this system.

2/ The squad lacked quality in key positions.

Finishing 15th felt unfair. Many points were lost not because of coaching, but due to:

Individual errors
Selfish play
Poor team chemistry
Weakness in the front three
Lack of physicality in key matches

This season should be much better because:

1/ Physicality is improving.

2/ Players are training in Amorim’s system from the start of the season, every day.

3/ We signed three strong attacking players.

Amorim’s system needs two dynamic, athletic ball carriers in midfield we’re targeting Baleba for this.

Onana is error-prone, so we’re looking for a better goalkeeper to give the defense confidence.

"I understand that the system is not 100% if the players are not following it. But then, why are you choosing them in the squad? Bruno in the double pivot is not consistent. Try Mainoo there.

This team will not improve under him — it’s simply not going to get better. We need to wake up and put an end to this nightmare. There’s a reason West Ham and Liverpool didn’t hire him.

"We all see how tough things have been lately — the criticism, the doubts, the pressure. But I want Ruben to remember something crucial: he is a winner. Built a legacy at Sporting —  won trophies, rewrote expectations, showed what a manager from Lisbon could achieve. That wasn’t luck. That was vision, character, and grit.

Everything new brings challenges. What he is facing at Manchester United is part of the journey — the test. It’s when things are hard that his identity, his  philosophy, his belief in what football can be really matter the most. The man who turned Sporting into a force didn’t do so by giving up when the going got tough — he did it by standing firm, learning fast, and pushing forward.

So keep your head high. Reconnect with why you do this, what you believe in, and what you’ve already proven you can deliver. The road may be bumpy now, but if you stay true to your methods, courageous in your decisions, and faithful to your principles, there’s a real chance to leave a mark here too.

And they just beat Sunderland today playing the same system, and they played well today too, by the way. So is the system really to blame? All these pundits and the media. If you're a good player, you can adapt to a different system. Amorim isn't asking a forward to play in defence, or a central midfielder to go into goal or play as a wingback. It's, at worst, a slight change in position, but the main thing is their responsibilities are different now. Good players should be able to adapt to that.

Ten Hag and now Amorhim seemed to want to attack to suit the fans and skeptics but we were conceding too many goals to be effective and too easily I might add.

"Since Sir Alex retired, many famous head coaches have taken charge of this club. However, most of them have struggled under the weight of expectations from the fans, media, and club supporters. In my view, they often acted like they didn’t see the issues clearly. But Amorim feels different to me. He has openly acknowledged the flaws and weaknesses of the club. He never uses empty, overly optimistic words without evidence. Instead, he clearly shares his vision and long-term goals. Even if we’re not there yet, he seems to be steadily moving closer to that future. The match against Real Sociedad was a good example of his vision taking shape. I’ve always supported Manchester United, and I would be truly grateful to witness a new era of glory in the near future.",en,2025-10-06 03:51:51.637044,Positive,0.19353535353535356,

"Be careful Mate. Most of what you find appealing about Amorim is wrapped in what he has been saying. And what he is saying is what you and the fanbase has seen and already know. By comparison  the former Manager, Ten Hag, gave politically correct responses that was disingenuous at best. Ten Hag tried to pull the wool over our eyes but Amorim simply gets out ahead by stating the obvious. That this team is bad is something we all can see, that he is not doing well is what we all can see. So be careful in backing a Manager who tells you what you see and judge him by what he does. Amorim came in November when the team was in 13th. He has  been in charge for some 20 or so Prem games and the team is still 13th. We all agree the team is bad, but he was hired to get improvement and by improvement that would mean above 13th. If he had this team 8th, or anywhere in the top 10, then his work would be judge as successful and the good feelings would be justified. The above game and the last 4 has come against 12th place Real Sociedad, 19th place Ipwich and 18th place Leicester. Wait for the next ten games and see if he still feels different to you. If United finish in the top 10 then by all means , have hope for a better future, if they remain where they were....in the bottom 10, be concern.",en,2025-10-06 03:51:51.637047,Positive,0.10117187500000002,

I’d be behind Amorim more if he dropped some of the older heads that have sacked 3 or 4 managers and he tried to future plan a bit and play the likes of Amad at RWB, Heaven and Yoro at CB with De Ligt in the middle, Dorgu at LWB, Mainoo as one of the two CDMs (and stopped playing Bruno there) and went with the new front 3 of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko. Even if we did struggle, at least I could see a future vision with younger players and new signings in it and I’d be willing to give him the season. If he goes with Bruno again playing deeper, Altay in goal, Shaw and Maguire at the back etc then he’s sacking himself at the end of the day.

"No matter if you prefer 4-3-3 or 3-4-3, every coach and formation needs time to build.
If you have players who can adapt to different styles, they will adjust quickly  if not, you can’t expect them to switch formations overnight.

Last season, our squad lacked quality players who could play top-level football maybe only 2–3 players stood out. In attack, it was mostly Bruno carrying us, while Amad was injured for half the season.

When Amorim arrived, he didn’t have much time to train the team. He knows only one system, so we switched from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3. The results were poor for two main reasons:

1/ Players didn’t have enough training in this system.

2/ The squad lacked quality in key positions.

Finishing 15th felt unfair. Many points were lost not because of coaching, but due to:

Individual errors
Selfish play
Poor team chemistry
Weakness in the front three
Lack of physicality in key matches

This season should be much better because:

1/ Physicality is improving.

2/ Players are training in Amorim’s system from the start of the season, every day.

3/ We signed three strong attacking players.

Amorim’s system needs two dynamic, athletic ball carriers in midfield we’re targeting Baleba for this.

Onana is error-prone, so we’re looking for a better goalkeeper to give the defense confidence.

Changing formation or coach won’t magically fix things overnight. Let’s back Amorim for another season to fully build his system.",en,2025-10-06 03:51:55.516363,Positive,0.04166666666666666,

"Hi, my name is Daniela and I'm a Portuguese big football fan. More then just a football fan, I'm a big supporter or Sporting Club de Portugal 💚🦁, one of the biggest clubs in Portugal where a lot of stars came from, including Mr. Ruben Amorim. In spite of being a Benfiquista (Benfica supporter) since his childhood and playing for Benfica for many years, he gave his biggest step forward as a coach at Sporting. And from what I've seen from the last few months in Manchester, I've been having such a big deja vu right now. Just like Man. United, Sporting was terribly down,  with no unity, no identity, nowhere to go. Everything changed when in the final of Liga Cup (winter competition), Sporting was defeated by Sporting Club Braga and guess who was their coach? Ruben. Since that game, just like always, Sporting had the vision to hire him for such a high price, 13M€. And let me tell ya, that he entered in march and till the end of that season he couldn't do much more. The season was already ruined. As well, we lost against Lask and we didn't make it to the European Competitions. However, in the next year, we became champions after 19 years. Thanks to Ruben and his legacy, we became champions 3 times in five years, we became champions without him and the sportive director and we became champions twice in a row. Hoping we will win the third one. With all of this, I need to say that Ruben isn't just any coach. He is a long term coach with the big capacity to communicate and keep the team united. And I'm a 100% sure, he will make it just like he overcame the challenges from the other teams he coached. So I just hope every supporter keeps the faith and confidence in him and not stay just for the fast results.",en,2025-10-06 03:52:12.836587,Positive,0.10860634920634922,

"Yeah I’m sorry to say this bud, but after supporting this club since the day I was born, a week after the treble win in 99, I have gotten to the point where I genuinely believe this club is finished. It’s been realistically finished for many years, and there’s even the argument to be made that the club we once knew hasn’t actually existed since 2005 when these snakes took over the club. Honestly, the real fans left in 2005. Us who stayed are part of the problem. We are the plastics. We never voted with our wallets, and we basically told the Glazers it was okay to be complacent, by not actually boycotting this club until change occurred. So honestly, I genuinely think there’s no shame in walking away now and letting the club fade into nothingness. I really hope I’m wrong, but my head says it’s over, and I’ve started listening to my head for the last year, thanks to my heart letting me get hurt",en,2025-10-06 03:52:12.839538,Positive,0.19062500000000004,

"Imma yap a bit about Man United rn. One of their biggest issues? They can’t play against low-block teams. When the opponent parks the bus, United can’t move the ball through tight spaces or create proper chances. And the striker + some mid wingers? Couldn’t finish their dinner.

Against deep defenses, Bruno can’t just spam long balls or hit quick counters and without that, chances dry up. Amorim’s United has actually looked decent vs the Big 6 (purely talking style here), but Bruno’s built for counter attacking, not possession. He’s not press resistant and loses the ball too much for a team tryna play slow, controlled football. 

His best performance was against Liverpool at Anfield his words, not mine, lol. Over all these years, he’s only had one game where he was disciplined, kept possession, and didn’t just hoof the ball. Says a lot.

Mainoo is that press resistant, composed, possession type baller. Pair him with a proper CDM someone like Rodri, Zubimendi, or Caicedo who can drive through midfield and play with their back to goal and top 4 is locked.

For years, Bruno was the only standout in a mid squad. Now they’ve got PL proven players and a striker, so this season’s the real test. If these wingers flop, we all know who to blame. But if they sign that CDM and pair with Mainoo and run a front three of Cunha–Sesko–Mbeumo? That’s beautiful, disciplined, possession football that can actually hurt teams.

Oh and btw, only two clubs were ever in for Bruno, United under Ole (counter-attacking) and Spurs under Mourinho… also counter-attacking. Says a lot.",en,2025-10-06 03:52:13.710959,Positive,0.1099647266313933,
"Possession is overrated but crucial, still it's not complete story. United is focused more on attack, they need to be strong in transition mostly as currently during transition their mid is super shaky. Casemiro is slow and Bruno is not a defensive midfielder per se but still he is forced to go deeper and start attack from backline. If they could replace Casemiro with Baleba or any good DM, Bruno will be able to play like a playmaker which is his natural role.",en,2025-10-06 03:52:13.710960,Positive,0.12179487179487179,
"@@randomguy_069 Yeah, Casemiro is shaky and Bruno’s not a 6, but that’s not what I was getting at. The point is, United don’t have a midfielder who’s press-resistant, can play with their back to goal, and link defense to attack. You need at least two proper no. 6s with those qualities.

City has Rodri and Kovačić who can play deeper and carry the ball forward. Chelsea has Caicedo and even Cucurella when he inverts. Liverpool has Mac Allister and Gravenberch. United? Ugarte and Casemiro… pathetic. That’s why Bruno ends up dropping into a 6 role to connect defense to attack, and he’s just not good at it.

Even if you put him as a pure playmaker, it’s not going to magically work. Like I said, he’s a counter-attacking player he needs space around him, otherwise he’s useless. He’d fit perfectly in most Serie A clubs, Atlético Madrid, or last year’s Ancelotti Real Madrid.

He’s not disciplined and can’t control the rhythm of the game. Honestly, he’s a stat-padding merchant. His “chance creation” is basically spamming hundreds of long balls or through balls, losing possession in the process, and maybe one of them ends up being dangerous. Over the past few years, he was just the average guy in a bad squad, which tricked people into thinking he was elite. 

You will see what I was tryna say abt Bruno in this new season.",en,2025-10-06 03:52:13.710961,Negative,-0.10375836284927194,

I am targeting 5th for this season. Can be done. We all know Arsenal is the best defensive side and those are the manners in which they score goals 😂.

Kobee mainoo! I swear I need to be around the players and the manager for just 5 games I'll make each and every player give the best out ot them on the pitch In each game.

I got united In my heart for years, and I can do anything for them to comeback like before. Just let me be around for five matches. if not throw me out!!! I'm speaking out of heart for Manchester united I'm not an ordinary fan. This club is a life for me! I wish this man united officials sees this comment.
